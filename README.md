## Dashboards 

### ðŸ“– Hotel PMS Dashboard

A hotel PMS (property management system) is a system managing the information about reservations of hotel rooms:
Who reserved a room of type X for the period from T1 to T2, the status of the reservation and so on.

This dashboard reproduces the PMS dashboard.

### ðŸ“Š Internal Dashboards

What kind of dashboards can we build for the company/hotel by utilizing the PMS data? 

- Hotel usage: Number of occupied rooms. Number of guests.
- Sales: Revenue. Revenue per occupied room (RevPOR).
- Marketing: Sales/Number of guests by country. Number of families. Marketing segments and distribution channels. 
- Cancellation: Cancellation rate (by country), survival rate, number of no-shows.
